  <!--Body of Email (Introduction)-->
  <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
  <p>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us 
    at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of 
    your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, 
    in the following sections.
  </p>

  <!--Body of Email (Questions and Answers)-->
  <h1>Starting dates</h1>
  <p>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, 
    however it would suit us better if you could start 
    at the beginning of a semester; 
    the start dates for each one are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so 
    which start date you would prefer.
  </p>
  <p> 
    You can find more information about

    on our website.

  <h1>Subject of study</h1>
  <p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded 
    research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in 
    the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, 
    dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to 
    have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we 
    were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li> <!--First study-->
      Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol 
      (C14H12O3.)
    </li>
    <li> <!--Second study-->
      Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at 
      temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), 
      when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 
      × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)
    </li>
    <li><!--Third study-->
      HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these 
    subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, 
    required staff and other resources, and anything else you think 
    we'd need to know? Thanks.
  </p>

  <h1>Exotic dance moves</h1>
  <p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did 
    study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite 
    dances are as follows, with definitions:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>
      A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, 
      a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage 
      their livestock to be "fruitful".
    </dd>
    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>
      Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they 
      used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in 
      a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly 
      tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he 
      thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
    </dd>
    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>
      An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in 
      the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by 
      "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern 
      Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just 
      moving like this because they were really cold.
