  <!--Body of Email (Introduction)-->
  <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
  <p>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us 
    at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of 
    your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, 
    in the following sections.
  </p>

  <!--Body of Email (Questions and Answers)-->
  <h1>Starting dates</h1>
  <p>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, 
    however it would suit us better if you could start 
    at the beginning of a semester; 
    the start dates for each one are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so 
    which start date you would prefer.
  </p>
  <p> 
    You can find more information about

    on our website.

  <h1>Subject of study</h1>
  <p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded 
    research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in 
    the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, 
    dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to 
    have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we 
    were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li> <!--First-->
      Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol 
      (C14H12O3.)
    </li>
    <li> <!--Second-->
      Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at 
      temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), 
      when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 
      × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)
    </li>
    <li><!--Third-->
      HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these 
    subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, 
    required staff and other resources, and anything else you think 
    we'd need to know? Thanks.
  </p>
